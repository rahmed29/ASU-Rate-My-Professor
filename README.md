# ASU Rate My Professor

This browser extension for FireFox allows you to view the RMP ratings next to professor names in the ASU course catalog.
You can download the extension here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asu-ratemyprofessor/

This extension is quite hacky and depending on what filter you apply to the class search, you may have to refresh the page to properly fetch ratings. Despite all that it works for my needs and I don't feel like fixing it
